rootimg
=======

The rootimg program is a simple command line application that takes
the number of a display, and creates a new window on the default
display with the image from the root window display given on the
command line. If no argument is given on the command line, the value
of $DISPLAY is assumed.

Builing and Running
===================

1) cd into the rootimg directory and enter "make". There are some
   warnings regarding types in the printf statements, but there should
   be no errors.
   *** NOTE: You have to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH env  variable with:
   $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH = "/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig"
   $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

2) In a new terminal window start Xorg with:
   $ Xorg :1

3) In another terminal window start an X application that takes the
   "-display" command line argument. Such as:
   $ xeyes -display :1 &

4) Now run rootimg with
   $ ./rootimg :1
   You should see the xeyes image in a new Xquartz window.


ISSUES
======

I have encountered an odd bug where, if I have not already opened an
Xquartz window, when rootimg is run, Xquartz tries to open but fails,
then tries to open again and fails.
