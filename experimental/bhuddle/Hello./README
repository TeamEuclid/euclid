Hello

This is a setup project to make a Coco application 
which switches between two images when given keyboard
input (the down arrow key).

To run the project in Xcode follow these steps:

To the run image flipper from the repo:
1. Cleared recent projects in x code (If you've recently
   opened this project).
2. In Xcode Go to file > open and navigate the source 
   tree to the "Hello.xcodeproj" file. Open this project.
3. You may need to change some of the views (Views >
   navigator > show project navigator) after opening
   the project this way.
