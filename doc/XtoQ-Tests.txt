 */

/**
 * General Functionality
 */

1)  Run autogen.sh, configure, and sudo make install.  Run the
    application after this.

2)  From the menu bar at the top of the screen, under 'Applications'
    drop down menu select xlogo with the mouse.

3)  Drag the xlogo window with the mouse to the upper right hand corner
    of the screen.  Then drag it to the lower right hand corner of
    the screen.
    Finally drag it to the lower left hand corner of the screen.

4)  Open up xeyes.  Drag this window with the mouse to the lower left.
    Then to the lower right and finally to the upper right corner
    of the screen.

5)  Open up xclock.  Drag this window diagonally with the mouse to the
    lower right corner of the screen.

6)  Open up Xterm, with the mouse drag this window to the center
    of the screen.

7)  With the mouse move the xeyes window to the closest corner of the
    xterm window so that xeyes will still be visible behind the xterm
    window.

8)  Do the same with xlogo and xclock.

9)  Click on xterm so that xeyes, xlogo, and xclock are all behind the
    xterm window.

10) Rotate through the focus of each window with the mouse by clicking on
    the title bar of the window.

11) Quit the XtoQ application under XtoQ by selecting Quit or by the
    shortcut key of "cmd+q".

12) At the terminal, check that the Xorg connection is closed and all
    other running applications (xeyes, xclock, xterm, xlogo) are closed.
    (By running "ps" at the terminal.)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Xlogo should pop up in the upper left hand corner of
the screen.  It should stay the same as it is moved from corner to
corner.  Xeyes should open in the same location that xlogo opens from.
It should also stay the same dimension as it is moved from corner to
corner.  The same should happen with xclock.  Xterm will open in the
same corner of the screen as all other applications have.  After dragging
them all to the center, as described above, switching focus of windows
is can be seen by the title bar of the selected window is more vivid in
color.  Windows not in focus will have a dull appearance to their title
bar (usually faded gray.)  Quitting the application will close down all
open applications by either using key shortcut or selecting quit from
menu.  Ideally when 'ps' is run on the terminal, nothing will show up
except from the current terminal window.

/**
 * Testing Input
 */

1)  Run the application.

2)  Open xterm under 'Applications' menu by clicking on xterm.

3)  Click in the window and type "echo hello world".

4)  Verify that it echo's the correct response.

5)  Quit the XtoQ application by selecting quit under XtoQ.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:  Xterm should open up and the keyboard mapping should
correspond to the keys correctly.  This test can be extended by typing
in different inputs and examining how they should be the same (so that
keys special characters and modifiers) are included as well.

/**
 * Testing Output
 */

1)  Run the application.

2)  Open up xeyes by clicking on xeyes under the applications menu.
    Make sure the eyes follow the mouse.

3)  Open up xclock by clicking on xclock under the applications menu.
    Watch the hand on the clock to make sure it is moving and updating
    properly.

4)  The above step might be easier to see if first opening xterm (or
    in terminal) and running "xclock -digital -update 1 -display :0"
    or similar.

5)  Quit the XtoQ application by selecting quit under XtoQ.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:  Both xeyes and xclock should open in the upper left
hand corner of the screen.  The clocks hands should move (every minute)
and the eyes should follow the mouse when it is inside the window
boundaries as well as outside the window.  As mentioned above, it might
be easier to tell of an update with something that updates more often
than every minute, this is where digital xclock comes into play.  By
typing in the command listed above, the digital clock will update every
second, thus making visual updates easier to notice.

/**
 * Testing Exiting
 */

1)  Run the application.

2)  Open up xeyes under the applications menu.  Move it to a different
    location on the screen by clicking on the title bar and dragging it.

3)  Do the same with xterm, xclock, and xlogo.

4)  Close all the applications that are open by clicking the red x button
    and quit XtoQ by selecting quit under XtoQ's menu.

5)  Open up a terminal and type "ps".

6)  Verify that all the running applications are closed, along with
    the Xorg connection. (xeyes, xclock, xterm, and xlogo are no longer
    running on the system.)

7)  Repeat steps 1-6 but on step 4 quit the XtoQ application without
    closing all the open applications (i.e. leave xterm, xeyes, xlogo,
    and xclock open upon quitting.)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:  All applications should open in the upper left hand
corner of the screen.  All applications should close by clicking on the
red close button on the upper left corner of their window.  After closing
the windows manually and exiting the program, none should remain when
'ps' is run on the terminal.  The same goes when the program is quit
without closing all the windows down manually.

/**
 * Testing Resizing
 */
1)  Run the application.

2)  Open up xlogo, xclock, xterm, and xeyes by selecting them from the
    drop down menu under 'Applications'.

3)  Since xeyes was the last application opened, click and drag the
    lower right corner of the window and drag it with the mouse to
    approximately double the size of the current xeyes window.
    (Making the window bigger)

4)  Close xeyes by clicking the red close button.

5)  Xterm should be the next visible window.  Click and drag the lower
    right corner of this window to approximately half the size of the
    current xterm window. (Making the window smaller)

6)  Close xterm by clicking the red close button.

7)  Xclock will be the next visible window.  Click and drag the right
    vertical side of the window to double the current width.

8)  Next click and drag the bottom side of the window to double the
    current height of the window.

9)  Close the xclock window by clicking the red close button.

10) Finally, xlogo should be the only open window.

11) Click the green maximize button to bring the window to full screen.

12) Click and drag the right vertical side of the window to half the
    current width.

13) Click and drag the bottom side of the window to half the current
    height.

14) Close the xlogo window by clicking the red close button.

15) Quit XtoQ by selecting quit on the drop down menu under XtoQ.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:  Xlogo, xclock, xterm, and xeyes should all open up
in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  Xeyes when resized should
update accordingly displaying a larger set of eyes to follow the mouse
around the screen.  Notice this resizing does both X and Y cooridnates,
increasing the size of the window.  Xterm opens as a larger window and
was best choice to shrink.  This resizing decreases both X and Y
resulting in a smaller xterm window.  Xclock will be resized in a
different manner then the previous two windows.  First the width will
be doubled (increase in X) and then height will be doubled (increase in
Y).  This ensures that height and width can be modified independent of
each other.  Xlogo is the last window to be modified and should maximize
to the full resolution of the screen.  This corner case may not be dealt
with by the capstone team, so it is alright if the program breaks at this
point.  Ideally, it should maximize to the full screen resolution and
should then be decreased in width and height.  After each modification of
the windows size it should update appropriately.  The program should exit
Normally after this has taken place.
