Xtoq - X.org Rootless Compositing Window Manager


Building
========

The xtoq project can be built using GNU autotools. 
From the top level directory, execute the commands:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Note that 'make install' packages the application as a Cocoa app, so
it will create a directory named 'xtoq.app'. The actual executable is
copied into this directory.

For testing, the 'prefix' variable should be defined to be a directory
that the user has write access to. A call to configure would look
like:

$ ./configure -prefix=/some/local/dir

The 'make install' command will install the 'xtoq.app' directory into
the /bin directory inside of the prefix given above.
