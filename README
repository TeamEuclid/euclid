Xtoq - X.org Rootless Compositing Window Manager

Building
========

The xtoq project can be built using GNU autotools.
From the top level directory, execute the commands:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Note that 'make install' packages the application as a Cocoa app, so
it will create a directory named 'xtoq.app'. The actual executable is
copied into this directory.

For testing, the 'prefix' variable should be defined to be a directory
that the user has write access to. A call to configure would look
like:

$ ./configure -prefix=/some/local/dir

The 'make install' command will install the 'xtoq.app' directory into
the /bin directory inside of the prefix given above.

Running
========
To run xtoq.app:

$ /Applications/XtoQ.app/Contents/MacOS/xtoq

X11 programs can be run from the Applications menu within xtoq.app. You can also
start apps from the command line by running them on the dummy driver (display) that xtoq.app is using.
